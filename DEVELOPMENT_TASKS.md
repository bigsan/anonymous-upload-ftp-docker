# Development Task Lists

This document records the task progression during the development of the FTP server solutions.

## Phase 1: Initial FTP Server Implementation

**Goal**: Create a containerized FTP server with anonymous upload capabilities

### Task List 1 - Initial Implementation
- [x] **Create Dockerfile for FTP server with anonymous upload** (High Priority)
  - Used Alpine Linux base image
  - Installed vsftpd FTP server
  - Created FTP user and directory structure
  - Configured permissions for anonymous uploads

- [x] **Create docker-compose.yml for testing** (High Priority)
  - FTP server service with port mappings (21, 21100-21110)
  - Volume mapping for persistent storage
  - Test client container for verification

- [x] **Configure FTP server settings for anonymous access** (Medium Priority)
  - Enabled anonymous access in vsftpd.conf
  - Configured upload permissions
  - Set passive mode port range
  - Disabled local user authentication

- [x] **Test the setup with docker compose** (Medium Priority)
  - Built and started containers successfully
  - Verified anonymous FTP upload functionality
  - Confirmed file persistence on host system

**Status**: ✅ **Completed** - Initial vsftpd solution working with uploads to `/pub` subdirectory

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Solution with Root Directory Uploads

**Goal**: Allow anonymous uploads directly to root directory (`/`) and provide dual solutions

### Task List 2 - Dual Solution Implementation
- [x] **Rename current Dockerfile to Dockerfile.proftpd** (High Priority)
  - Preserved working ProFTPD solution
  - Renamed for clarity and dual-solution support

- [x] **Create Dockerfile.vsftpd for the vsftpd solution** (High Priority)
  - Restored original vsftpd implementation
  - Maintained `/pub` subdirectory upload capability
  - Included complete vsftpd.conf configuration

- [x] **Update docker-compose.yml to support both images** (High Priority)
  - Added Docker Compose profiles (`proftpd`, `vsftpd`)
  - Separate service definitions for each FTP server
  - Maintained shared test client configuration
  - Port and volume mappings for both solutions

- [x] **Update documentation to reflect both solutions** (Medium Priority)
  - Updated FTP_SERVER_SETUP.md with dual solution instructions
  - Created comprehensive README.md with quick start guide
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with current project state
  - Documented differences between solutions

- [x] **Test both solutions work correctly** (Medium Priority)
  - Verified vsftpd solution: uploads to `/pub` subdirectory
  - Verified ProFTPD solution: uploads to root directory (`/`)
  - Confirmed Docker Compose profiles work correctly
  - Validated file persistence on host system

**Status**: ✅ **Completed** - Dual solution implementation successful

## Key Challenges Encountered

### 1. vsftpd Security Restrictions
- **Issue**: `500 OOPS: vsftpd: refusing to run with writable root inside chroot()`
- **Solution**: Used ProFTPD for root directory uploads, kept vsftpd for traditional `/pub` structure

### 2. ProFTPD Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: Module conflicts causing container restart loops
- **Solution**: Disabled problematic modules (`mod_ctrls`, `mod_delay`) and created runtime directories

### 3. Docker Compose Orchestration
- **Issue**: Supporting multiple FTP server options without conflicts
- **Solution**: Implemented Docker Compose profiles for selective deployment

---

## Final Architecture

### Two Complete Solutions:

#### Solution 1: vsftpd (Traditional)
- **Upload Directory**: `/pub` subdirectory
- **Security**: Built-in chroot security model
- **Use Case**: Standard FTP setups requiring directory structure
- **Command**: `docker compose --profile vsftpd up -d`

#### Solution 2: ProFTPD (Flexible)
- **Upload Directory**: Root directory (`/`)
- **Security**: Configurable security policies
- **Use Case**: Direct root uploads without subdirectories
- **Command**: `docker compose --profile proftpd up -d`

### Shared Components:
- Alpine Linux base images
- Passive mode FTP (ports 21100-21110)
- Anonymous authentication
- Host volume mapping to `./ftp-data/`
- Test client container for verification

---

## Testing Results

Both solutions successfully tested and verified:
- ✅ Anonymous login without password
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ File persistence on host system
- ✅ Docker Compose profile switching
- ✅ Container networking and port mapping

## Lessons Learned

1. **Different FTP servers have different security models** - vsftpd's chroot restrictions vs ProFTPD's flexibility
2. **Docker Compose profiles are effective** for managing multiple solution variants
3. **Comprehensive documentation is crucial** when providing multiple implementation options
4. **Testing both solutions is essential** to ensure feature parity and reliability
